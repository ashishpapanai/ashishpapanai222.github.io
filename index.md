### Work Experience: 

#### [Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective](https://github.com/probml/pyprobml/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Aashishpapanai)
Open Source Contributor **Mar. 2021 - Apr. 2021**


Coded 16+ statistical algorithms and their implementations mentioned in the book Machine Learning:A Probabilistic Perspective (by Kevin P. Murphy) in Python using libraries like SciPy, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch and used various Mathematical and statistical approaches.

**Formulae/Algorithms Implemented:** Naive Bayes classifier applied to text data (bag of words), Credible Intervals, Conditional densities (to compare Generative and Discriminatory model), EM Algorithm (Visualise the lower bounds), Second order approximation of a function (Newton’s Method), Newton’s method for Non-Convex functions, Data interpolation using joint. 

#### [CAMP K12](https://campk12.com/)

Artificial Intelligence Instructor **Jul. 2020 – Nov. 2020**


Delivered 400+ lectures to 25+ students enrolled in the Artificial Intelligence Course. Developed and taught AI Projects ranging from basic to advanced difficulty using TensorFlow js and Teachable Machines, covering the concept of REST APIs, Conditionals. Loops, OOPs, and Functions.

### Projects: 

#### [StockDL](/https://ashishpapanai.github.io/stockDL/)
A financial deep learning library for stocks price prediction and comparison with traditional investment
strategies.
- It uses LSTM (Long Short Term Memory), a state of art deep learning algorithm, which analyses the sequential data of the stock opening prizes for each trading day in the six years considered.
- The improved version of the algorithm uses a convolution neural network for feature extraction, drastically reducing the computation cost and time.
- The library has over 11k+ users with over 500+ weekly downloads on PyPI (Python Package Index).

#### [ChessJS](https://ashishpapanai.github.io/chessJS/)
ChessJS is a blend of traditional decision-making algorithms, and the engine has a maximum performance
rating of 2300+ ELO.
- The engine uses a min-max search algorithm used for turn-based games. The player with white pieces tries to maximize the score, whereas the player with black pieces minimizes the score.
- The computation speed is reduced by Alpha-Beta pruning, a mathematical approach to discard the branches that will not be visited while traversing the tree during the min-max tree traversal.
- The engine is rewarded with a score based on a points table created considering the basic principles of chess. White side tried to maximise the score and black tries to minimise it.

#### [IMGprove](https://github.com/ashishpapanai/IMGprove)
Developed deep-learning solution to improve the quality of low-resolution images. This API improves the resolution of a 100x100 image to 400x400. Also helpful in optimizing data storage in cloud based servers without compromising much with the quality of the image.
• Currently working on an improved and novel solution/implementation of SRGAN is being worked on for videos, which will be used as an add-on with YouTube API. This add-on will help the users with limited internet bandwidth watch the videos at a much higher resolution by up-scaling the video frames locally instead of streaming the video at a higher resolution.

#### [AIde](https://github.com/ashishpapanai/)
Developed AIde - (An audio guide for visually impaired persons navigation and assistance).
• Developed AIde - (An audio guide for visually impaired persons navigation and assistance). The
project is an improved implementation of YOLO v3 Algorithm for object detection and classification
and Canny’s Edge detection algorithm for lane detection and navigation.

#### [Stalemate](https://github.com/ashishpapanai/stalemate/)
Stalemate is an ongoing project. It is a Unified Chess Interface Engine, integrated with any chess website or GUI as an engine to analyze, practice, and compete. The current target is to cross the threshold of 2800 ratings without extensive use of computational resources.
Proposed features of Stalemate:
- It will identify itself with a UCI Command.
- It will receive the board position as FEN and will spend at max 2000ms to search for the best move.
- The best move might change with time and as the depth of the search tree increases. The engine will also generate a list of moves for both sides. This list is called principal variation.
